                    <div id="biography">
                        Davey Bob had a rough childhood growing up. He has
                        noticed how his life has changed and developed as he
                        started to notice the children around him as he was
                        growing up. The life of the children were different
                        compared to his. He has always been wondering and he
                        found the answer as he was watchly 2 kids closely around
                        his neighborhood. The answer was the environment and the
                        people surrounding the child. He now focuses on helping
                        children grow the life they are meant to live by
                        providing joy and care to everyone. They are the next
                        generation, we need to teach and help them strive for
                        the better to create a better future.
